# Hi 👋
It's my old personal website, my current one is [this one](https://maciejjalocha.vercel.app).

Nevertheless, it nicely represents **use of several React libraries** with an **unconventional design**!
## Stack ⚙️
Project was written in React.js 16 and used these great libraries of:
* [react-swipeable-views](https://react-swipeable-views.com/demos/demos/) in order to make slides swipeable
* [react-horizontal-timeline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-horizontal-timeline) to create a timeline 
* [react-particles-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-particles-js) which is responsible for my site background.
* [react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router) so that transitions behave more like a normal subsites.
